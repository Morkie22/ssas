# 100 Piece Puzzle Project

This project creates a simple 100 piece puzzle layout using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

## Directory Structure

```
sass-puzzle/
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── index.html
└── style.scss
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your system.

### Installing Sass

If you haven't installed Sass globally, you can install it using npm:

```sh
npm install -g sass
```

### Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd path/to/sass-puzzle
   ```

### Compiling SCSS to CSS

Run the following command to compile `style.scss` into `css/style.css`:

```sh
sass style.scss css/style.css
```

This will generate the `style.css` file inside the `css` directory.

### Running the Project

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to view the puzzle.
2. You should see a grid of 100 round puzzle pieces, each numbered and styled according to the SCSS file.

## File Descriptions

### index.html

This file contains the HTML structure for the puzzle project. It includes a link to the compiled CSS file and a script to generate the puzzle pieces dynamically.

### style.scss

This file contains the SCSS code to style the puzzle pieces. It uses variables and nested rules to create a modular and maintainable stylesheet.

### css/style.css

This file is the compiled CSS output from `style.scss`. It is generated by running the `sass` command and should not be edited directly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the following:

1. Ensure that `style.scss` is correctly compiled into `css/style.css`.
2. Verify that the `css/style.css` file is correctly linked in `index.html`.
3. Clear your browser cache or open the page in an incognito window to ensure you're seeing the latest changes.
4. Open the browser's developer tools and check the console for any errors.
